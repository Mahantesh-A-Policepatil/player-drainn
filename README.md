#Description
-------------------------------------------------------------
Let's imagine we have a game two teams, each team have 5 players, every player have drain (level to measure player strength). 
Below given numbers in brackets represent drain of each players. 
Team A [35, 100, 20, 50, 40] 
Team B [35, 10, 30, 20, 90]  
You need to assign team A player in a way where it exceed team B playerâ€™s drain. 
Even if one player loses the battle then team A will not win. 
The solution for the above result will be Team A [40, 20, 35, 50, 100] Team B [35, 10, 30, 20, 90]  
Input: should be from artisan command to collect all the players data comma separated. 
Example artisan should promote Enter A Teams players: 30, 100, 20, 50, 40 
Enter B team players: 35, 10, 30, 20, 90  
If A team can win than the output will be: Win 
If A team lose than the output will be: Lose
